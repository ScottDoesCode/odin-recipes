    <h2>Meatfeast Pizza Recipe</h2>
    <p>A Meatfeast pizza is a hearty and indulgent pizza topped with a variety of meats. It typically includes a
        combination of pepperoni, sausage, bacon, ham, and sometimes ground beef or chicken, all piled on a cheesy,
        flavorful base with tomato sauce. Perfect for meat lovers, it’s a savory and filling choice with bold flavors in
        every bite.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce (or pizza sauce)</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese (shredded)</li>
        <li>Pepperoni (sliced)</li>
        <li>Italian sausage (crumbled or sliced)</li>
        <li>Bacon (crispy and chopped)</li>
        <li>Ham (sliced)</li>
        <li>Chicken (optional, cooked and sliced)</li>
        <li>Dried oregano (optional, for seasoning)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness, then transfer it to a
            baking sheet or pizza stone.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin, even layer of tomato sauce (or pizza sauce) over the dough, leaving a small border around the
            edges for the crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, covering it evenly.</li>
        <li>Arrange the pepperoni, crumbled Italian sausage, chopped bacon, sliced ham, and any other meats you’re using
            (ground beef or chicken) evenly over the pizza.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a small amount of olive oil over the top for a golden, crispy finish. You can also sprinkle a little
            dried oregano or Italian seasoning for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the
            cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two. Slice it up, garnish
            with extra herbs if desired, and serve hot!</li>
    </ol>
